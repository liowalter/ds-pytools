simple tools for data handling and analysis in Python



	WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using Python libraries.

The examples are presented as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). 

We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The [miniconda](http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution provides a minimal Python and conda installation. A more comprehensive, but also larger distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes many well-known Python libraries for Data Science.

Additional installation instructions for Python libraries required by different tools can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.
