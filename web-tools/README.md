# Python Toolbox: Web-Tools

some tools for automated web-scraping, accessing APIs and downloading web content in Python



	WORK IN PROGRESS

This folder contains examples of how to solve various problems in retrieving web content using Python libraries.

Scrape carefully! Check the Terms of Services of a website and its robots.txt. Also mind copyright issues and inspect its Terms of Use.

The examples are presented as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). 

We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The [miniconda](http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution provides a minimal Python and conda installation. A more comprehensive, but also larger distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes many well-known Python libraries for Data Science.

Additional installation instructions for Python libraries required by different tools can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.
